# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Oruku Polama application.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented in `index.html` with strict policies
- Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- Allows only trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Enhanced Zod schemas with strict validation rules
- Character limits and regex patterns for all form fields
- Input sanitization utility to remove potentially dangerous content
- Protection against script injection and HTML injection

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Client-side rate limiting to prevent form spam
- Configurable limits (default: 5 requests per minute)
- Per-user rate limiting based on email address

### 4. Secure API Communications
- Timeout protection for API calls (10-second default)
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Secure fetch utility with abort controllers

### 5. Build Security
- Console logs removed in production builds
- Debugger statements stripped from production
- Minification and obfuscation of source code

### 6. Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy for camera, microphone, etc.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
You can configure security settings using environment variables:

```bash
# API Configuration
VITE_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL=your_actual_script_url
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=10000

# Security Configuration
VITE_ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=5
VITE_ENABLE_INPUT_SANITIZATION=true

# Logging Configuration
VITE_ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG=false
VITE_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=true
```

### Security Configuration File
The main security configuration is in `src/config/security.ts`:

- Input validation limits
- Rate limiting settings
- API timeout configuration
- Input sanitization utilities

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated both client-side and sanitized
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and spam submissions
3. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose system internals
4. **Content Security**: CSP headers prevent most XSS attacks
5. **Build Security**: Production builds remove development artifacts

## Security Checklist

- [x] Content Security Policy implemented
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Rate limiting for form submissions
- [x] Secure API communication with timeouts
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Production build optimizations
- [x] Environment variable configuration
- [x] Error handling improvements

## Recommendations for Production

1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure the application is served over HTTPS
2. **API Security**: Implement server-side validation and rate limiting
3. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and logging
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting the development team directly rather than creating a public issue.
